# Lab 1: Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) & Data Exploration using Parametric Methods

## 1. Introduction

This notebook aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply parametric methods to analyze sentiment data extracted from social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). The objective is to understand the distribution of sentiments across platforms and over time, as well as to conduct statistical tests to uncover relationships between variables.

## 2. Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, pearsonr
import statsmodels.api as sm
```

## 3. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

### 3.1 Data Loading

```python
# Importing the CSV file and storing it in df
df = pd.read_csv("/content/sentiment_analysis.csv")
```

### 3.2 Initial Exploration

```python
# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Display the shape (rows and columns)
print(f"Shape of the dataset: {df.shape}")

# Display info about the dataset
print(df.info())

# Display statistical description of the dataset
print(df.describe())
```

### Insights:

- **Temporal Distribution**: The data spans a wide range of years, with a concentration in recent years (2020-2023), suggesting the dataset predominantly includes more recent tweets.
- **Monthly Activity**: Tweets are evenly distributed across different months without significant skew, indicating consistent activity throughout the year.
- **Daily Distribution**: There is a relatively uniform distribution of tweets across days of the month, suggesting consistent engagement over days.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4.1 Univariate Analysis

```python
# Univariate Analysis of 'sentiment' variable
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='sentiment', data=df)
plt.title('Distribution of Sentiments')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### Insight:

- The distribution of sentiments shows the frequency of each sentiment type (positive, negative, neutral) in the dataset.
- Neutral sentiments are the most common, followed by positive and negative.

```python
# Univariate Analysis of 'Platform' variable
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='Platform', data=df)
plt.title('Distribution of Platforms')
plt.xlabel('Platform')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

### Insight:

- This graph displays the number of posts from each platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).
- Facebook and Instagram have more posts compared to Twitter.

### 4.2 Bivariate Analysis

```python
# Bivariate Analysis: Sentiment vs Platform
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='sentiment', hue='Platform', data=df)
plt.title('Sentiment Distribution by Platform')
plt.xlabel('Sentiment')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.legend(title='Platform')
plt.show()
```

### Insight:

- This graph compares sentiment distribution across different platforms.
- For instance, Instagram may show a higher count of positive sentiments indicating a more positive user base.

## 5. Statistical Tests and Correlation Analysis

### 5.1 Chi-square Test of Independence

```python
# Chi-square test of independence
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['sentiment'], df['Platform'])
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
print(f"Chi-square test of independence: chi2={chi2}, p={p}")
```

### Insight:

- The Chi-square test of independence result shows a statistically significant association between sentiment and platform.
- This means the sentiment expressed in the tweets is not independent of the platform on which they were posted.

### 5.2 Correlation Analysis

```python
# Correlation analysis
sentiment_counts = df.groupby(['Year', 'Month', 'Day'])['sentiment'].value_counts().reset_index(name='count')
sentiment_counts = sentiment_counts.pivot_table(index=['Year', 'Month', 'Day'], columns='sentiment', values='count', fill_value=0)
corr, p = pearsonr(sentiment_counts['positive'], sentiment_counts['negative'])
print(f"Correlation analysis: corr={corr}, p={p}")
```

### Insight:

- The correlation analysis found a small link between positive and negative sentiments, but it's not very strong.
- There's a significant relationship between the variables, indicating that changes in one sentiment type might influence the other.

## 6. Probability Plots

To create probability plots to assess whether the data follows a specific distribution, such as the normal distribution, we can use the qqplot function from the statsmodels.graphics.gofplots module.

```python
# Select numerical variables
numerical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns

# Create probability plots for numerical variables
for column in numerical_columns:
    sm.qqplot(df[column], line='s')
    plt.title(f"Probability Plot for {column}")
    plt.show()
```

### Key Insights of the Project

1. **Sentiment Distribution**:
   - The dataset shows a predominance of neutral sentiments, followed by positive and negative sentiments.
   - Different social media platforms exhibit varying distributions of sentiment types, with Instagram potentially having a more positive user base compared to Facebook and Twitter.

2. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Tweet activity shows consistent engagement across months and days, suggesting steady user interaction over time.
   - There are variations in sentiment expression across different times of the day, indicating potential peak periods of user activity and sentiment expression.

3. **Statistical Relationships**:
   - Statistical tests, such as the chi-square test of independence, revealed significant associations between sentiment and the platform used for posting.
   - Correlation analysis highlighted modest relationships between positive and negative sentiments over time, suggesting interconnected patterns in sentiment expression.

4. **Visualization and Data Distribution**:
   - Visualizations like count plots and pair plots provided intuitive insights into sentiment trends and their relationships with temporal variables (Year, Month, Day).
   - Probability plots assessed the normality of numerical variables, aiding in understanding data distributions and identifying potential outliers.

## 7. Conclusion

In conclusion, this project effectively explored and analyzed sentiment data extracted from social media platforms. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of sentiment expression across platforms and over time. The analysis revealed distinct patterns in sentiment distribution and temporal trends, providing valuable insights for understanding user sentiments on social media. By leveraging statistical methods and visualization techniques, this study contributes to the broader understanding of sentiment analysis in the context of social media data. Future research could delve deeper into sentiment dynamics influenced by external events and user demographics, further enriching our understanding of online sentiment behavior.
